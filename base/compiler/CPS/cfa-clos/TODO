Unexplored paths:

- Global cost function:
    Take the current closure decision and cps, evaluate the cost

- Sharing as a live range splitting problem:
    A variable may be introduced at a function and not used until much later,
    but it has to be carried around, moved from a closure to another.
    Can ``spill'' these.
