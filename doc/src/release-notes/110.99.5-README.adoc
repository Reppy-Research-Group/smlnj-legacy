== Summary

This patch release fixes a large number of bugs in the "legacy" version
of *SML/NJ*; implements some missing features from the
https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/[*Standard ML Basis Library*], and
includes some improvements to the *SML/NJ Library*.

== Details

=== Compiler

* Some minor improvements in the REPL's pretty printing.

=== CM

* The *system/cmb-make* script now runs with the `CM_VERBOSE` environment variable
  set to `false` by default (use the `-verbose` option for the old behavior).  It
  also now sets the `PATH` environment variable to include the directory where the
  *sml* command lives when it is given as an argument to *cmb-make*.

=== Basis Library

* Complete rewrite of the mechanisms used to implement conversions
  between strings and reals.  As part of this rewrite, we implemented the
  support for the `StringCvt.EXACT` formatting mode and implemented the
  missing `Real.toDecimal`/`fromDecimal` functions.  The real-string
  conversions is based on the https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu[Ryu library]
  and associated https://doi.org/10.1145/3296979.3192369[PLDI paper]
  by Ulf Adams.

* Added missing implementation of `Real64.nextAfter` function.

* Added `Unsafe.Real64` structure that implements bit casts between
  double-precision reals and 64-bit words.

=== SML/NJ Library

In addition to the bug fixes noted below, the following improvements
made to the **SML/NJ Library**:

* Added the `JSONDecode` structure to the *JSON* library.  This module implements
  a set of combinators (inspired by the *Elm* `JSON.Decode` module)
  for decoding *JSON* values.

* Added `insertWith`, `insertWithi`, and `findAndRemove` operations to the
  `HASH_TABLE` and `MONO_HASH_TABLE` interfaces (and corresponding
  implementations).

* Fixed a bug in `Random.randReal` on 32-bit systems.

* Fixed the error checking and documentation for the `subArray` function
  in the `DynamicArray` structure and `DynamicArrayFn` functor.

* Fixes to the `subArray` and `truncate` functions in the dynamic array
  implementation (both structure `DynamicArray` and functor `DynamicArrayFn`).

* Add `EditDistance` module to utility library.

* Reworked the `UTF8` structure to impose stricter validation of the
  encodings.  Added the `Invalid` exception for when an invalid encoding
  is encountered and replaced uses of the `Domain` exception with `Invalid`.
  Also added the `size'` function for getting the number of UTF-8
  characters in a substring.

* Added modules for the representation of booleans, integers, and words
  as hash-consed values to the *HashCons* library.

== Bugs

Here is a list of the issues that are fixed (or closed) with this release.
We include the original bug numbers for bugs that were reported using the
gforge bug tracker.

* The implementations of `PackWord64Little.update` and `PackWord64Big.update`
  were swapped on 64-bit platforms.

tested some of them:

=== 32-bit macOS issues

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[x86 installer]
for {version} works on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps because the version of **Xcode**
distributed for Mojave does not include a 32-bit SDK.

Another issue that you may encounter
when building on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is set on the
shell script.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----
and resume the build.
