== Summary

This patch release fixes a large number of bugs in the "legacy" version
of *SML/NJ* and adds some new functions to the *SML/NJ Library*.

== GitHub Migration

With this release, we have migrated the legacy branch from our own **svn** server
to a https://github.com/smlnj/legacy[**GitHub** repository].  This migration
is the first step in migrating everything to **GitHub**.

In addition, we have retired the gforge bug-tracking infrastructure in favor of using
**GitHub** issues.  We have prepopulated the issues for the legacy repository with
the entries from the gforge bug database.

Since issues are associated with a repository, we now have separate trackers for the
legacy and main development versions.  While most bugs that are present in one version
will also be present in the other version, it is not necessary to create two issues
when reporting a bug.

== Details

=== Basis Library

Added support for the following proposed https://github.com/SMLFamily/BasisLibrary[**Basis
Library** extensions]:

--
  * https://github.com/SMLFamily/BasisLibrary/wiki/2022-001-Add-value-tau-to-MATH-signature[
    2022-001 Add value tau to MATH signature]
--

=== SML/NJ Library

--
  * Added the `findAndRemove` function to `ORD_MAP` interface.
  * Generalized comparisons on ordered maps; added `equiv` and
    `extends` functions to `ORD_MAP` interface and made the type of
    `collate` more polymorphic.
  * The *SExp* library now uses *Scheme* syntax for string values.
  * The *SExp* parser accepts empty files as valid input (producing
    an empty list of S-Expressions).
--

=== 32-bit macOS issues

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[x86 installer]
for {version} works on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps because the version of **Xcode**
distributed for Mojave does not include a 32-bit SDK.

Another issue that you may encounter
when building on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is set on the
shell script.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----

and resume the build.

== Closed Issues

Here is a list of the issues that are fixed (or closed) with this release.
We include the original bug numbers for bugs that were reported using the
https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/projects/smlnj-bugs[gforge bug tracker].
