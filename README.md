# SML/NJ Legacy

This project is the old version of Standard ML of New Jersey
that continues to support older systems (e.g., 32-bit machines).
We will continue to fix bugs and make minor improvements while
the main development branch matures.  We will also backport
additions to the SML/NJ Library and other components.
